# Portfolio-Optimization
$\bullet$ Simple Portfolio Optimization  
1. Chose 9 stocks (SPY, AAPL, GS, WMT, JNJ, NVDA, AMZN, NFLX, TSLA) to model using 2023 daily data
2. Optimized portfolio weights for target return and target risk by minimizing $\beta$ and CAPM functions 
3. Given the higher $\beta$ values of NVDA and TSLA, they represent smaller allocations in the risk-minimized portfolio
